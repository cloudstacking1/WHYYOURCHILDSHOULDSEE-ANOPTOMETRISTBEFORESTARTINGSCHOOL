            <h2>What is Dry Eye Syndrome?</h2>
            <p>Dry Eye Syndrome, or keratoconjunctivitis sicca, is a common condition that occurs when your tears aren't able to provide adequate lubrication for your eyes. This may happen for a variety of reasons your eyes might not produce enough tears, or the tears you do produce might evaporate too quickly. Either way, the result is discomfort, vision issues, and even damage to the surface of your eyes if left untreated.

              <h3>Artificial Tears and Lubricants: </h3>
            </li>
            <p>For mild cases, over-the-counter artificial tears can provide temporary relief by lubricating the ocular surface. Lubricating gels or ointments may be recommended for overnight use to reduce symptoms during sleep.

            <p>In cases where inflammation is present, medications such as cyclosporine A (Restasis) or lifitegrast (Xiidra) may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and increase tear production.</p>
            <li>
              <h3>Punctal Plugs:</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Punctal plugs are small devices inserted into the tear ducts to block drainage, thereby increasing tear retention on the ocular surface.?

                <div id="faq1" class="faq-content">A: Regular eye exams are crucial for maintaining optimal eye health and vision. The American Optometric Association recommends that adults have a comprehensive  <a href="https://eyedealeyecarenj.com/optometrist-service/dry-eye-treatment-and-management/"style="color: aqua;">eye exam</a> every one to two years, depending on age, risk factors, and whether you currently wear glasses or contact lenses. Children and older adults may require more frequent visits. Routine exams help in early detection of vision problems and eye conditions, ensuring timely intervention and effective vision correction.?

                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq2', this)">Q2: What is the difference between an optometrist and an ophthalmologist <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq2" class="faq-content">A: An optometrist is a healthcare professional who provides primary vision care, including sight testing and correction, diagnosis, treatment, and management of vision changes. They conduct eye exams, prescribe glasses and contact lenses, and detect certain eye abnormalities. An ophthalmologist, on the other hand, is a medical doctor specializing in eye and vision care, capable of performing eye surgery and treating all kinds of eye diseases. Both play vital roles in comprehensive eye care, and your choice depends on your specific vision needs.?**</div>

                <button onclick="toggleFAQ('faq3', this)">Q3: How do I choose the right designer frames for my glasses <span>?</span></button>
                <div id="faq3" class="faq-content">A: Selecting the perfect designer frames involves considering both functionality and personal style. Factors such as face shape, skin tone, lifestyle, and prescription requirements play significant roles.
